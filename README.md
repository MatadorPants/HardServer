TO DO

Determine which items to ban/restrict
- TnT
- I've seen some restrict pistons, lava buckets, etc.
- With prison, do we want to restrict enchantments until a certain level?

Research Factions and see if we need to change any configurations

Set up HomeSpawnPlus -- limits, warm ups, cool downs [HomeSpawnPlus currently erroring out on start up]

PermissionsEX 

VirtualChest Plugin -- Only able to open it in the shop areas
